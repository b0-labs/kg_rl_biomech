# Knowledge Graph-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Biological Mechanism Discovery: A Comprehensive Methodology

## 1. Introduction

Biological mechanism discovery from experimental data represents a fundamental challenge at the intersection of computational biology, machine learning, and pharmaceutical sciences. Traditional approaches to understanding drug-biological system interactions rely either on mechanistic modeling with assumed functional forms or on unconstrained mathematical exploration that often yields biologically implausible relationships.

Current mechanism discovery methods fall into several categories: (1) mechanistic modeling approaches such as NONMEM and Phoenix that assume specific functional forms based on biological knowledge but limit discovery to variations of known mechanisms; (2) symbolic regression methods including genetic programming and neural symbolic regression that explore broad mathematical spaces but often produce biologically meaningless relationships; (3) neural approaches such as Neural ODEs that can capture complex dynamics but lack interpretability; and (4) knowledge-driven methods that incorporate biological constraints but typically require manual specification of candidate mechanisms.

Let $\mathcal{D} = \{(\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N$ represent observed pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, where $\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ denotes input features (drug concentrations, time, covariates) and $y_i \in \mathbb{R}$ represents the observed biological response. The mechanism discovery problem seeks to identify a function $f: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $y_i \approx f(\mathbf{x}_i; \boldsymbol{\theta})$ where $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ represents mechanism parameters, with the additional constraint that $f$ must be biologically interpretable and plausible.

Our work bridges the gap between unconstrained exploration and mechanistic modeling by incorporating structured biological knowledge to guide automated mechanism discovery. We formalize biological knowledge as a knowledge graph $\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{C})$, where $\mathcal{V}$ represents biological entities (enzymes, receptors, transporters, drugs), $\mathcal{E}$ denotes relationships between entities, $\mathcal{R}$ defines relationship types (catalysis, inhibition, binding, transport), and $\mathcal{C}$ maps relationships to valid mathematical constraints.

The reinforcement learning framework treats mechanism discovery as a sequential decision-making problem. An agent navigates a space of possible mechanism modifications, receiving rewards based on both model fit to data and biological plausibility as encoded in the knowledge graph. This formulation naturally incorporates the exploration-exploitation tradeoff inherent in scientific discovery while maintaining biological interpretability.

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

### 2.1 Assumptions and Constraints

Our theoretical framework operates under several key assumptions:

**Data Generation Assumptions**: We assume that observed biological responses are generated by underlying deterministic mechanisms with additive Gaussian noise: $y_i = f^*(\mathbf{x}_i; \boldsymbol{\theta}^*) + \epsilon_i$, where $f^*$ represents the true biological mechanism, $\boldsymbol{\theta}^*$ are true parameters, and $\epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$. This assumption is justified by the central limit theorem for measurement errors and is standard in pharmacometric modeling.

**Knowledge Graph Completeness**: We assume the biological knowledge graph $\mathcal{G}$ contains a representative subset of established biological relationships relevant to the domain of interest. While complete biological knowledge is impossible, we require sufficient coverage to meaningfully constrain the mechanism space.

**Mechanism Compositionality**: We assume that complex biological mechanisms can be decomposed into simpler, well-understood components that combine through known mathematical operations. This enables hierarchical mechanism construction guided by the knowledge graph and is supported by biological modularity principles. Formally, we assume the existence of a finite set of primitive mechanisms $\mathcal{M}_{\text{primitive}}$ and composition operators $\mathcal{O} = \{+, \times, \circ, \text{max}, \text{min}\}$ such that any mechanism $m \in \mathcal{M}$ can be expressed as a composition tree with leaves in $\mathcal{M}_{\text{primitive}}$.

**Biological Plausibility Scoring**: We assume that biological plausibility can be quantified through a scoring function $\phi: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow [0,1]$, where $\mathcal{M}$ represents the space of possible mechanisms. This score reflects consistency with established biological knowledge encoded in $\mathcal{G}$.

**Markov Property**: We assume that the mechanism construction process satisfies the Markov property, where the next state depends only on the current state and action, not on the full history. This is reasonable since biological constraints can be evaluated based on the current mechanism structure without requiring knowledge of the construction path.

### 2.2 Mathematical Formulation

Let $\mathcal{M}$ denote the space of all possible biological mechanisms, where each mechanism $m \in \mathcal{M}$ is represented as a mathematical expression with parameters. We define a mechanism as $m = (f_m, \boldsymbol{\theta}_m)$, where $f_m: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the functional form and $\boldsymbol{\theta}_m \in \Theta_m \subset \mathbb{R}^{p_m}$ are the associated parameters with $p_m$ denoting the number of parameters.

The biological knowledge graph is formally defined as:
$$\mathcal{G} = (\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{C})$$

where:
- $\mathcal{V} = \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{|\mathcal{V}|}\}$ represents biological entities
- $\mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{R}$ represents directed relationships
- $\mathcal{R} = \{r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_{|\mathcal{R}|}\}$ defines relationship types
- $\mathcal{C}: \mathcal{R} \rightarrow 2^{\mathcal{F}}$ maps relationships to sets of valid functional forms

Here, $\mathcal{F}$ represents the space of all mathematical functional forms expressible in our framework, and $2^{\mathcal{F}}$ denotes the power set of $\mathcal{F}$.

Each relationship type $r \in \mathcal{R}$ constrains the mathematical forms that can connect related entities. For example, an enzyme-substrate relationship may allow Michaelis-Menten kinetics: $\mathcal{C}(\text{catalysis}) \ni \frac{V_{\max} \cdot S}{K_m + S}$, with associated parameter constraints $V_{\max} > 0$ and $K_m > 0$.

### 2.3 Biological Plausibility Scoring

We define a biological plausibility function $\phi: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow [0,1]$ that evaluates mechanism consistency with the knowledge graph:

$$\phi(m) = \frac{1}{Z} \sum_{i=1}^{|C_m|} w_i \cdot \mathbb{I}[c_i \in \mathcal{G}] \cdot \exp(-\alpha d_{\mathcal{G}}(c_i)) \cdot \mathbb{I}[\text{constraints satisfied}]$$

where:
- $C_m$ represents the set of biological concepts invoked by mechanism $m$
- $w_i \geq 0$ denotes concept importance weights satisfying $\sum_i w_i = 1$
- $\mathbb{I}[\cdot]$ is the indicator function
- $d_{\mathcal{G}}(c_i)$ measures the graph distance from $c_i$ to established knowledge
- $\alpha > 0$ controls distance penalty strength
- $Z = \sum_{i=1}^{|C_m|} w_i \cdot \mathbb{I}[c_i \in \mathcal{G}] \cdot \exp(-\alpha d_{\mathcal{G}}(c_i)) \cdot \mathbb{I}[\text{constraints satisfied}]$ ensures normalization

The graph distance $d_{\mathcal{G}}(c_i)$ is computed as the shortest path length from concept $c_i$ to the nearest well-established concept in $\mathcal{G}$:
$$d_{\mathcal{G}}(c_i) = \min_{v \in \mathcal{V}_{\text{core}}} \text{shortest\_path}(c_i, v)$$
where $\mathcal{V}_{\text{core}} \subset \mathcal{V}$ represents the set of core, well-validated biological concepts with high confidence scores.

### 2.4 Reinforcement Learning Formulation

We formulate mechanism discovery as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) defined by the tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, P, R, \gamma)$:

**State Space**: $\mathcal{S}$ represents the space of partial mechanism constructions. Each state $s \in \mathcal{S}$ encodes:
- Current mechanism structure as an abstract syntax tree $T_s$
- Available biological entities $V_s \subseteq \mathcal{V}$
- Construction history $H_s$ to prevent cycles
- Current parameter constraints $\Theta_s$ from biological knowledge

Formally, $s = (T_s, V_s, H_s, \Theta_s)$ where:
- $T_s$ is a rooted tree with nodes representing functional components
- $V_s$ contains entities that can be incorporated given current constraints
- $H_s$ maintains the sequence of previous actions to enforce acyclicity
- $\Theta_s = \prod_{i} [\theta_i^{\min}, \theta_i^{\max}]$ defines feasible parameter ranges

**Action Space**: $\mathcal{A}$ contains actions for mechanism modification:
- $a_{\text{add}}(v, r, pos)$: Add entity $v$ with relationship $r$ at position $pos$
- $a_{\text{modify}}(\theta_j, \delta)$: Modify parameter $\theta_j$ by amount $\delta$
- $a_{\text{combine}}(op, i, j)$: Combine subtrees $i$ and $j$ using operation $op \in \{+, \times, \circ\}$
- $a_{\text{terminate}}$: Complete mechanism construction

**Transition Function**: $P(s'|s,a)$ defines the probability of reaching state $s'$ from state $s$ under action $a$:
$$P(s'|s,a) = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } a \text{ is biologically valid from } s \text{ and leads to } s' \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Biological validity is determined by checking consistency with $\mathcal{G}$ and satisfaction of all constraints in $\mathcal{C}$.

**Reward Function**: The reward function balances multiple objectives:
$$R(s, a, s') = \lambda_1 \cdot \Delta \mathcal{L}(s, s') + \lambda_2 \cdot \phi(m_{s'}) + \lambda_3 \cdot \mathcal{I}(m_{s'}) - \lambda_4 \cdot \mathcal{P}(a) - \lambda_5 \cdot \mathcal{V}(s')$$

where:
- $\Delta \mathcal{L}(s, s') = \mathcal{L}(m_s) - \mathcal{L}(m_{s'})$ represents improvement in negative log-likelihood
- $\phi(m_{s'})$ is the biological plausibility score
- $\mathcal{I}(m_{s'}) = \exp(-\lambda_c \cdot \text{complexity}(m_{s'}))$ measures interpretability
- $\mathcal{P}(a)$ penalizes computationally expensive actions
- $\mathcal{V}(s')$ penalizes constraint violations
- $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3, \lambda_4, \lambda_5 > 0$ are weighting parameters

**Discount Factor**: $\gamma \in [0, 1)$ balances immediate rewards with long-term mechanism quality.

### 2.5 Objective Function

The overall objective combines maximum likelihood estimation with biological plausibility and interpretability constraints:

$$\mathcal{J}(\boldsymbol{\theta}, m) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \log p(y_i | f_m(\mathbf{x}_i; \boldsymbol{\theta})) + \beta \cdot (1 - \phi(m)) + \eta \cdot \mathcal{C}(m)$$

where:
- $p(y_i | f_m(\mathbf{x}_i; \boldsymbol{\theta})) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(y_i - f_m(\mathbf{x}_i; \boldsymbol{\theta}))^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$ assumes Gaussian likelihood
- $\mathcal{C}(m) = \log_2(|\text{nodes}(T_m)|) + \sum_{i=1}^{|\boldsymbol{\theta}_m|} \log_2(\text{precision}(\theta_i))$ penalizes complexity
- $\beta, \eta > 0$ control the relative importance of biological plausibility and complexity

**Convergence Guarantee**: Under the assumption that the MDP has finite state and action spaces and the reward function is bounded, the policy gradient algorithm converges to a local optimum with probability 1 as the number of episodes approaches infinity.

**Sample Complexity**: The sample complexity for achieving $\epsilon$-optimal policy scales as $O(\frac{|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|}{\epsilon^2})$ under standard assumptions for finite MDPs.

## 3. Method

### 3.1 Algorithm Design

Our Knowledge Graph-Guided Reinforcement Learning (KG-RL) algorithm integrates biological knowledge with exploration-based mechanism discovery. We choose reinforcement learning over alternative approaches for several reasons: (1) it naturally handles the sequential nature of mechanism construction, (2) it can balance exploration and exploitation during discovery, (3) it allows incorporation of biological constraints as rewards, and (4) it can handle variable-length mechanism representations.

```

### 3.2 Knowledge Graph Integration

The knowledge graph constrains mechanism exploration through several mechanisms:

**Valid Action Filtering**: At each state $s_t$, the set of valid actions is restricted to those consistent with biological relationships in $\mathcal{G}$:
$$\mathcal{A}_{\text{valid}}(s_t) = \{a \in \mathcal{A} : \exists (v_i, v_j, r) \in \mathcal{E} \text{ supporting action } a \text{ and } \text{satisfies constraints in } \mathcal{C}(r)\}$$

**Hierarchical Mechanism Construction**: The knowledge graph encodes hierarchical relationships between biological concepts, enabling systematic progression from simple to complex mechanisms. We define a complexity ordering $\prec$ on mechanisms such that $m_1 \prec m_2$ if $m_1$ can be derived from $m_2$ through biological simplification operations defined in $\mathcal{G}$.

**Biological Constraint Propagation**: When adding components to a mechanism, the knowledge graph propagates constraints to ensure global biological consistency. For instance, adding an enzyme-catalyzed reaction automatically constrains kinetic parameters to physiologically reasonable ranges derived from $\mathcal{G}$.

### 3.3 Policy Network Architecture

The policy network employs a graph neural network (GNN) architecture to process both the current mechanism state and the biological knowledge graph:

$$\pi_\theta(a|s) = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{W}_{\text{out}} \cdot \text{GNN}(\mathbf{h}_s, \mathcal{G}; \theta_{\text{GNN}}))$$

where:
- $\mathbf{h}_s \in \mathbb{R}^{d_s}$ represents the current state embedding
- $\text{GNN}(\cdot): \mathbb{R}^{d_s} \times \mathcal{G} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d_h}$ processes the knowledge graph structure
- $\mathbf{W}_{\text{out}} \in \mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{A}| \times d_h}$ maps to action probabilities

The GNN uses Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with multi-head attention:
$$\mathbf{h}_v^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(\sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} \alpha_{vu}^{(k)} \mathbf{W}_k^{(l)} \mathbf{h}_u^{(l)}\right)$$

where:
- $K$ is the number of attention heads
- $\alpha_{vu}^{(k)}$ are attention weights computed as:
$$\alpha_{vu}^{(k)} = \frac{\exp(\text{LeakyReLU}(\mathbf{a}_k^T [\mathbf{W}_k^{(l)} \mathbf{h}_v^{(l)} || \mathbf{W}_k^{(l)} \mathbf{h}_u^{(l)}]))}{\sum_{w \in \mathcal{N}(v)} \exp(\text{LeakyReLU}(\mathbf{a}_k^T [\mathbf{W}_k^{(l)} \mathbf{h}_v^{(l)} || \mathbf{W}_k^{(l)} \mathbf{h}_w^{(l)}]))}$$

The value network uses a similar architecture:
$$V_\phi(s) = \mathbf{w}_v^T \cdot \text{GNN}(\mathbf{h}_s, \mathcal{G}; \phi_{\text{GNN}}) + b_v$$
where $\mathbf{w}_v \in \mathbb{R}^{d_h}$ and $b_v \in \mathbb{R}$ are learned parameters.

### 3.4 Parameter Optimization

For each discovered mechanism $m$, we optimize parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ using constrained optimization that incorporates biological knowledge:

$$\boldsymbol{\theta}^* = \arg\min_{\boldsymbol{\theta} \in \Theta_{\text{bio}}} \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) + \lambda_{\text{reg}} \|\boldsymbol{\theta}\|_2^2 + \lambda_{\text{bio}} \mathcal{R}_{\text{bio}}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$$

where:
- $\Theta_{\text{bio}} = \{\boldsymbol{\theta} : \theta_i^{\text{min}} \leq \theta_i \leq \theta_i^{\text{max}} \text{ for all } i\}$ represents biologically plausible ranges
- $\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - f_m(\mathbf{x}_i; \boldsymbol{\theta}))^2$ is the squared loss
- $\mathcal{R}_{\text{bio}}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \sum_i \exp(-(\theta_i - \mu_i)^2 / (2\sigma_i^2))$ encourages biologically typical values

### 3.5 Network Training

Both policy and value networks are trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm with the following updates:

**Policy Update**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{policy}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t\left[\min\left(r_t(\theta) A_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon_{\text{clip}}, 1+\epsilon_{\text{clip}}) A_t\right)\right]$$

where $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t|s_t)}$ and $A_t$ is the advantage estimate computed using Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE):
$$A_t = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (\gamma \lambda_{\text{GAE}})^l \delta_{t+l}$$
with $\delta_t = r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)$.

**Value Update**:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{value}}(\phi) = \mathbb{E}_t\left[(V_\phi(s_t) - R_t)^2\right]$$

where $R_t = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \gamma^l r_{t+l}$ is the discounted return.

**Computational Complexity**: The algorithm has time complexity $O(T \cdot S \cdot (|V|^2 + |E|))$ where $T$ is the number of episodes, $S$ is the maximum steps per episode, and $|V|, |E|$ are the knowledge graph size. Space complexity is $O(|V| \cdot d_h + |E| + |B|)$ where $|B|$ is the replay buffer size and $d_h$ is the hidden dimension.

## 4. Synthetic Data Generation

### 4.1 Mathematical Foundation

We generate synthetic biological systems using a hierarchical approach that builds complexity from fundamental biological principles. The generation process follows:

$$y(t, \mathbf{c}, \mathbf{p}) = f_{\text{mech}}(g_{\text{bio}}(\mathbf{c}, t, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{bio}}), \mathbf{p}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{sys}}) + \epsilon(t)$$

where:
- $y(t, \mathbf{c}, \mathbf{p}) \in \mathbb{R}$ represents the observed biological response
- $\mathbf{c} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_c}$ denotes drug concentrations
- $\mathbf{p} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_p}$ represents patient/system covariates
- $f_{\text{mech}}: \mathbb{R}^{n_g} \times \mathbb{R}^{n_p} \times \mathbb{R}^{n_s} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ links biological processes to observations
- $g_{\text{bio}}: \mathbb{R}^{n_c} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^{n_b} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n_g}$ models underlying biological processes
- $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{bio}} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_b}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{sys}} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_s}$ are biological and system parameters
- $\epsilon(t) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2(t))$ represents measurement noise

### 4.2 Enzyme Kinetics Systems

We generate data following extended Michaelis-Menten kinetics with various complexity levels:

**Level 1 - Basic Saturation**:
$$v = \frac{V_{\max} \cdot [S]}{K_m + [S]}$$

**Level 2 - Competitive Inhibition**:
$$v = \frac{V_{\max} \cdot [S]}{K_m(1 + \frac{[I]}{K_i}) + [S]}$$

**Level 3 - Allosteric Regulation**:
$$v = \frac{V_{\max} \cdot [S]^n}{K_m^n + [S]^n} \cdot \frac{1 + \alpha \frac{[A]}{K_A}}{1 + \frac{[A]}{K_A}}$$

**Level 4 - Multi-substrate with Product Inhibition**:
$$v = \frac{V_{\max} \cdot [S_1] \cdot [S_2]}{(K_{m1} + [S_1])(K_{m2} + [S_2])(1 + \frac{[P]}{K_p})}$$

Parameters are sampled from biologically informed distributions:
- $V_{\max} \sim \log\mathcal{N}(\mu_{V}, \sigma_{V}^2)$
- $K_m \sim \log\mathcal{N}(\mu_{K}, \sigma_{K}^2)$
- Hill coefficients $n \sim \mathcal{U}(1, 4)$
- Allosteric parameters: $\alpha \sim \log\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, $K_A \sim \log\mathcal{N}(\mu_A, \sigma_A^2)$

### 4.3 Multi-Scale Systems

Multi-scale mechanism discovery requires synthetic systems that couple molecular, cellular, and tissue-level processes:

**Molecular Level** (drug-target binding):
$$\frac{d[DR]}{dt} = k_{\text{on}} \cdot [D] \cdot [R] - k_{\text{off}} \cdot [DR]$$

**Cellular Level** (signal transduction):
$$\frac{d[S]}{dt} = k_{\text{trans}} \cdot f([DR]) - k_{\text{deg}} \cdot [S]$$

**Tissue Level** (physiological response):
$$\frac{dE}{dt} = E_{\max} \cdot \frac{[S]^{\gamma}}{EC_{50}^{\gamma} + [S]^{\gamma}} - k_{\text{out}} \cdot E$$

Cross-scale coupling functions $f(\cdot)$ reflect biological mechanisms:
- Receptor occupancy: $f([DR]) = \frac{[DR]}{[DR] + K_D}$
- Signal amplification: $f([DR]) = A \cdot ([DR])^n$
- Threshold activation: $f([DR]) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-([\text{DR}] - \theta)/\kappa)}$

### 4.4 Disease-State Mechanism Switching

We generate systems where biological parameters change based on disease biomarkers:

$$\boldsymbol{\theta}(t) = \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{healthy}} + (\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{disease}} - \boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{healthy}}) \cdot \sigma(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{b}(t) - \tau)$$

where:
- $\mathbf{b}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{n_b}$ represents time-varying biomarkers
- $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_b}$ are biomarker weights
- $\tau$ is a switching threshold
- $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$ is the sigmoid function

Biomarker dynamics follow a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process:
$$\frac{d\mathbf{b}}{dt} = -\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{b} - \boldsymbol{\mu}) + \mathbf{u}(t) + \boldsymbol{\xi}(t)$$

### 4.5 Drug Interaction Networks

For multi-drug systems, we generate interaction networks:

**Competitive Inhibition**:
$$v_i = \frac{V_{\max,i} \cdot [S_i]}{K_{m,i}(1 + \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{[S_j]}{K_{ij}}) + [S_i]}$$

**Non-competitive Inhibition**:
$$v_i = \frac{V_{\max,i} \cdot [S_i]}{(K_{m,i} + [S_i])(1 + \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{[S_j]}{K'_{ij}})}$$

**Enzyme Induction**:
$$V_{\max,i}(t) = V_{\max,i}^0 \cdot (1 + \sum_{j} I_{ij} \cdot \frac{[S_j]^{n_{ij}}}{IC_{50,ij}^{n_{ij}} + [S_j]^{n_{ij}}})$$

### 4.6 Noise Models

Biological measurements exhibit complex noise structures:

**Proportional Error Model**:
$$y_{\text{obs}} = y_{\text{true}} \cdot (1 + \epsilon_{\text{prop}})$$
where $\epsilon_{\text{prop}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{\text{prop}}^2)$

**Combined Error Model**:
$$y_{\text{obs}} = y_{\text{true}} + \epsilon_{\text{add}} + y_{\text{true}} \cdot \epsilon_{\text{prop}}$$

**Time-Correlated Noise**:
$$\epsilon(t) = \rho \cdot \epsilon(t-\Delta t) + \sqrt{1-\rho^2} \cdot \eta(t)$$
where $\eta(t) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$

**Heteroscedastic Noise**:
$$\sigma^2(c) = \sigma_0^2 + \sigma_1^2 \cdot c^{\alpha}$$

## 5. Experimental Design

### 5.1 Datasets

We evaluate on 500 synthetic systems across five categories:

**Dataset 1: Enzyme Kinetics Discovery** - 200 synthetic enzyme-substrate systems across 4 complexity levels, with mechanisms ranging from basic Michaelis-Menten to multi-substrate with product inhibition. Each system includes concentration-velocity data points with concentrations sampled log-uniformly.

**Dataset 2: Multi-Scale Mechanism Discovery** - 100 synthetic molecular-to-tissue coupling systems with hierarchical organization spanning molecular binding, cellular signaling, and tissue response. Time-series data captures dynamics across multiple scales.

**Dataset 3: Disease-State Mechanism Switching** - 50 synthetic systems with biomarker-dependent parameter changes, including longitudinal data covering healthy and disease states with various progression patterns.

**Dataset 4: Drug Interaction Networks** - 50 multi-drug systems with various interaction types including competitive, non-competitive, induction, and mixed inhibition. Concentration-response surfaces capture complex interaction patterns.

**Dataset 5: Hierarchical Complexity Progression** - 100 systems across complexity levels with nested ground truth mechanisms for systematic evaluation of progressive discovery capabilities.

### 5.2 Knowledge Graph Construction

Biological knowledge graphs integrate multiple curated sources including Gene Ontology for biological processes, KEGG pathways for metabolic networks, DrugBank for drug interactions, UniProt for protein functions, and ChEMBL for bioactivity data. The resulting graph encompasses biological entities, directed relationships with typed edges, hierarchical organization from molecular to physiological scales, and mathematical constraint rules linking relationships to functional forms.

### 5.3 Evaluation Metrics

**Discovery Accuracy**:
$$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{|\mathcal{M}_{\text{discovered}} \cap \mathcal{M}_{\text{true}}|}{|\mathcal{M}_{\text{true}}|}$$

**Biological Plausibility Score**:
$$\text{BPS} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{M}_{\text{discovered}}|} \sum_{m \in \mathcal{M}_{\text{discovered}}} \phi(m)$$

**Parameter Recovery Error**:
$$\text{PRE} = \frac{1}{|\boldsymbol{\theta}|} \sum_{i=1}^{|\boldsymbol{\theta}|} \frac{|\theta_i^{\text{est}} - \theta_i^{\text{true}}|}{|\theta_i^{\text{true}}|}$$

**Convergence Speed**: Episodes to reach 90% of final performance

**Interpretability Score**: 
$$\mathcal{I}(m) = \exp(-\lambda_c \cdot \text{complexity}(m))$$

### 5.4 Baseline Methods

We compare against:
- **Unconstrained RL**: Standard reinforcement learning without knowledge graph guidance
- **Symbolic Regression**: Genetic programming with standard mathematical operators

### 5.5 Experimental Protocol

Each experiment follows a standardized protocol:
1. Data split: 70% training, 15% validation, 15% testing
2. Hyperparameter optimization via Bayesian optimization
3. Multiple runs (5 independent seeds) for statistical significance
4. Cross-validation (3-fold) for robust performance estimation
5. Statistical testing using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni correction

## 6. Ablation Studies

### 6.1 Knowledge Graph Components

We systematically evaluate the contribution of knowledge graph components by comparing performance with full vs. reduced graphs (removing relationships randomly), testing impact of specific relationship types, and assessing hierarchical vs. flattened structures.

### 6.2 Reward Function Components

We isolate contributions of model fit ($\lambda_1$), biological plausibility ($\lambda_2$), and interpretability ($\lambda_3$) terms through factorial design experiments and sensitivity analysis.

### 6.3 Network Architecture

We compare GNN-based policy networks vs. standard feedforward networks, test different GNN architectures (GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT), and evaluate impact of network depth and width.

## 7. Implementation

### 7.1 Software Architecture

The implementation uses PyTorch for neural networks, PyTorch Geometric for graph neural networks, Stable Baselines3 for RL algorithms, NetworkX for knowledge graph operations, and SciPy for parameter optimization.

### 7.2 Computational Requirements

- Training: Single GPU with sufficient VRAM for GNN operations
- Inference: Standard CPU sufficient
- Memory: Proportional to knowledge graph size
- Storage: Scales with dataset size

### 7.3 Reproducibility

To ensure reproducibility, we provide fixed random seeds, deterministic network initialization, version-controlled dependencies, and containerized environments.

## 8. Discussion

This methodology presents a novel approach to biological mechanism discovery that integrates knowledge graphs with reinforcement learning. The framework balances exploration of mechanism space with biological constraints, enabling discovery of interpretable and plausible mechanisms. The comprehensive synthetic data framework provides robust validation across diverse biological scenarios.

Key contributions include the formal integration of biological knowledge through graph structures, the reinforcement learning formulation that naturally handles sequential mechanism construction, and the balance between mathematical rigor and biological interpretability.

Current limitations include reliance on knowledge graph completeness, computational cost for large mechanism spaces, and parameter identifiability in complex systems. Future work will focus on integration with experimental design, extension to stochastic systems, and application to real experimental datasets.

## 9. Conclusion

We present Knowledge Graph-Guided Reinforcement Learning for biological mechanism discovery, a methodology that combines the exploration capabilities of reinforcement learning with the constraint satisfaction of knowledge-based systems. The approach provides a principled framework for automated mechanism discovery that maintains biological plausibility while discovering novel relationships in experimental data.
